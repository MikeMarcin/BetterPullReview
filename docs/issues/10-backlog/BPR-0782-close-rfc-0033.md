# Verify and close RFC-BPR-0033

RFC base: `38f32226351f5cc8e4657d55c3e151d8450c6ce5`.

This card tracks formal closeout for its RFC. The checklist rows are the canonical
criteria of the live RFC; every row records the check run, its result and the commit.

## Closeout checklist

| Criterion | Result | Revision |
|---|---|---|
| **B1 — A close is a close.** Closing the last window of the last open profile never presents the chooser: on macOS the application stays resident with its menu bar and Dock icon and no window; on Windows and Linux it quits through the existing drain and Quit path; the restore records distinguish this close from Quit as RFC-BPR-0024 requires. | Not run; import only | No producing revision |
| **B2 — Reopening.** With no window on macOS, application activation, ⌘N, and choosing a profile from the Profiles menu open the most recently used profile's window at Home through the existing intents, without a second runtime owner and without touching another profile. | Not run; import only | No producing revision |
| **B3 — Failures go to a window.** A failed profile operation with a live window is reported in that window and does not present the chooser; the chooser shows its notice only while open, and is presented for a failure only when no window exists. | Not run; import only | No producing revision |
| **B4 — The chooser is rows.** The Profiles sheet shows one row per profile with avatar, name and state, selects the current profile on open, opens or focuses on Return and double-click, renames and creates in place with Save and Cancel, keeps text on Escape and on failure, shows one failure notice with Try again only after a failure, and has no permanent name field, status sentence or Reload button. | Not run; import only | No producing revision |
| **B5 — Rendered and reachable.** The sheet in its default, renaming, creating and failed states renders at 100, 125, 150 and 200 percent in the four appearances, every control is reachable by keyboard with an accessible name and the row state as its description, and the owner accepts the real macOS application through the attended-review workflow, including closing the last window and reopening from the Dock. | Not run; import only | No producing revision |

## Outcome

Reconcile every B row with direct evidence or a named unresolved criterion, run one integration pass over the desktop lifecycle and management courses, and record the truthful formal status.

## Acceptance

- All B1–B5 rows reference direct evidence or a specific unresolved criterion.
- One integration pass over the desktop lifecycle, activation and management courses is recorded with its revision.
- Formal closeout obeys canonical order and actual platform and attended results; RFC-BPR-0024 is not reopened.

## Evidence

Record the focused command or gesture, the direct surface, the result, the producing revision and the remaining limitation. Evidence is **not run** at pack authoring. Reuse still-valid prior results; never infer a native or attended verdict from a fixture or a mockup.

## Boundaries

No GitHub or GHES mutation, credential access, provider change or new preference is authorized by this card. The core decides, the host performs, Qt presents: no widget reaches a store, a vault, a provider or a process. No stylesheet or hard-coded palette. Follow the milestone exit rather than running an exhaustive app-wide course for this slice.
