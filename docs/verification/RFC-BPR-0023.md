# RFC-BPR-0023 Verification Plan

Status: **implementation authorized under mandate r1; M1 live audit complete; feature criteria pending**

Import baseline: `5a616354ae6ecd7ebbea608a9523a8388f590ab0`.

Immutable implementation RFC_BASE_SHA: `899090f39304dca5a2c0b034c4684a50ca73605a`.

Owner mandate r1 (2026-09-26) authorizes implementation, live-plan revision and
coordinator integration of completed milestones to main. This supersedes the
import-only deferral; it does not satisfy acceptance. The
[live audit and evidence allocation](RFC-BPR-0023-live-audit.md) and
[adopted plan](../rfcs/plans/rfc-bpr-0023-private-review/milestone-plan.json) govern
execution. The protected imported issue-plan bytes remain unchanged.

# Acceptance Traceability for RFC-BPR-0023

This matrix retains all imported feature obligations. The live audit reconciles
their current direct surfaces and evidence owners; feature checks have not run.

## Evidence rules

- A helper or unit-test-only composition does not prove public reachability.
- A static screenshot does not prove a command path, focus order, or mutation
  boundary.
- A fixture-authored model/effort value proves parsing and presentation, not
  that an external provider always returns the value.
- A local mock receipt does not prove ordinary GitHub body/identity semantics;
  use a designated target or a signed, independently readable recorded
  response as allowed by repository policy.
- A test that sees “no mutation” must instrument every mutation capability, not
  merely one adapter method.
- A migration test must inspect both data and the canonical schema; preserving
  text while leaving dual authorities is failure.
- Performance evidence must report active-set/changed-set work, page bounds,
  model reset counts, peak memory, and database growth for the tested fixture.

## Required architecture-conformance claims

| Claim | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Core has no forbidden dependency | Architecture-boundary gate plus include/link inventory |
| Host owns effects and serialized completions | Fake ports/manual executor tests with reordering, cancellation, duplicate completion |
| Qt emits intents and applies incremental deltas | Qt tests, model statistics, no direct adapter/store includes |
| Agent path is singular | Composition trace proves side chat and squash dispatch through existing invocation host |
| GitHub path is singular | Publish trace proves RFC-BPR-0008 coordinator and adapter only |
| Private/shared authority remains distinct | Database-loss test and independent server read |
| Provenance never exceeds evidence | Full/partial/conflicting/unknown capability fixtures and UI assertions |
| Source lineage is immutable | Digest and predecessor comparison before/after edits/composition/publication |

## Canonical criteria

| AC | Criterion | Result | Producing commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| AC-01 | A reviewer can create a PR-level or exact semantic-subject private thread, add reviewer turns, restart BetterPullReview, and recover the thread and its revision history exactly. | Not run | None |
| AC-02 | Side-chat prompts and complete assistant responses can be retained as turns without adding a second agent launch path, and the thread remains bound to the exact review revision it was created against. | Not run | None |
| AC-03 | Every turn revision has a typed actor. New reviewer text is `reviewer`, agent text names one exact `agent_run_id`, and migrated notes are `legacy_unknown`. | Not run | None |
| AC-04 | Editing agent-authored text creates a reviewer-authored successor with an immutable `edited_from` edge; the original bytes, actor, and run provenance remain inspectable. | Not run | None |
| AC-05 | Agent provenance retains requested, configured, protocol-reported, and content-self-reported model/effort facts separately. Missing facts remain unknown, disagreements are visible, and no value is inferred from a profile or executable name. | Not run | None |
| AC-06 | One agent session can produce multiple uniquely identified runs and finding sets without collision; retained provenance remains readable after session catalog pruning. | Not run | None |
| AC-07 | Thread subjects and composition targets use exact semantic identities. Head/epoch movement produces visible stale or unplaceable state and never a nearest-line or silent reanchor. | Not run | None |
| AC-08 | A reviewer can select exact revisions/findings, open a composition workspace, inspect sources and provenance, and produce a reviewer-authored, exact-copy, or explicitly agent-assisted candidate. | Not run | None |
| AC-09 | `Squash to Draft` creates only local composition/draft state. Tests prove zero GitHub mutation, zero resolve operation, and zero review submission at this step. | Not run | None |
| AC-10 | Sources remain present and traceable after composition. Multiple exact targets require explicit target selection or Split into Drafts; the product does not guess. | Not run | None |
| AC-11 | Accepting a candidate records the exact composition revision on a durable RFC-BPR-0008 draft and survives restart. | Not run | None |
| AC-12 | Publishing requires a separate explicit gesture and traverses the existing target/head/acting-identity/idempotency/safe-target mutation path. | Not run | None |
| AC-13 | A successful publication records local lineage to the returned server comment and reconciled server state. The GitHub body contains no hidden or mandatory BetterPullReview/AI marker and appears under the authenticated reviewer's identity. | Not run | None |
| AC-14 | Legacy local notes migrate byte-for-byte into one-turn private threads with unknown authorship, no invented provenance, no ID reuse, and no second private-note authority. | Not run | None |
| AC-15 | Private thread pages, provenance details, and composition inputs are bounded and cursor-loaded. Quota, oversize, and stale-source cases refuse whole and never silently truncate. | Not run | None |
| AC-16 | Private content reaches an agent only when exact source revisions are explicitly selected and successfully revalidated at dispatch. | Not run | None |
| AC-17 | Deleting the local ledger or an explicitly selected private thread changes no GitHub state; the remaining ledger recovers transactionally after abrupt termination. | Not run | None |
| AC-18 | The complete workflow is reachable through the real BetterPullReview composition root and is usable by keyboard and assistive technology at 100%, 125%, and 200% scale without clipping or whole-model resets for a bounded turn update. | Not run | None |

The public-path course also covers RFC-BPR-0022 native and file-permalink
representations, logical receipt recovery, and distinct approved-prose/public-body
digests. The quota course covers 1 MiB bodies through 512 KiB continuations.

## Import verification scope

Only pack integrity, mapping/dependency/status consistency, documentation checks,
and diff whitespace are verified by this import. No build, CTest, UI, migration,
agent, GitHub, or GHES feature evidence was run. See [import record](../rfcs/assets/betterpullreview-rfc-0022-private-review-threads-pack-v1.LIVE_IMPORT.md).

## M1 — live audit and execution plan

Assignment: BPR-0576, `m1-live-audit`, implementer `/root/rfc0023_m1`, mandate
r1, branch `codex/rfc-bpr-0023`. Readiness commit `ff134d74`; MASK claim commit
`02537bcaf836186c9c74dd14f7e58a0d699a9c02`. The planning candidate is the commit
introducing the live audit and adopted plan; the completion/handoff below names
its exact revision. The coordinator owns landing this milestone on main.

| Check | Result and scope |
|---|---|
| `python3 scripts/verify_documentation.py --root .` | PASS, `DOCUMENTATION_OK`; live links, RFC/index and board structure. |
| `python3 tests/scripts/verify_documentation_tests.py` | PASS, 64 tests; expected negative fixtures print errors. |
| MASK `issue_board.py ... validate --rfc RFC-BPR-0023 --json` | PASS, valid across 1,208 indexed cards, scoped workflow errors empty. |
| MASK plan prepare/adopt/inspect and checkpoint bind | PASS, ten milestones, sixteen whole-card obligations covered exactly once; M1 has BPR-0576 and four explicit exits. Semantic acceptance remains engineering judgment. |
| Retained manifest / baseline comparison | PASS, all 26 listed payload hashes; retained pack and imported source-only issue plan unchanged against implementation base. |
| Canonical acceptance comparison | PASS, all eighteen RFC criterion texts byte-identical to implementation base. |
| `git diff --check` | PASS. |
| Production public-path audit | Source trace completed for current chat, findings, revisioned shared drafts and logical publication. No runtime execution or feature acceptance claimed. |

Self-review reconciled the ledger v6 and recovery v5 frontiers, volatile profile
shared drafts, updater salvage, temporary finding-claim chat replies, existing
Comments/Notes/Tour navigation and dedicated composition pages. It also exposed
the current all-note expansion in chat and the missing named total encoded-input
bound as explicit BPR-0577/0581/0582/0583 design obligations.

The initial `move --to ready` was refused because the helper requires the exact
lane `20-ready`; it changed nothing. The first claim after a successful move
refused its already-dirty LIVE_IMPORT link. Committing only that readiness move
and editable live link repaired the bookkeeping precondition; the repeated
claim succeeded. Neither refusal weakened the protected-path guard.

No product source, build, CTest, external agent, vault, GitHub/GHES mutation,
push, PR or installed package action was performed. No configured build tree
was inherited. BPR-0576 is planning acceptance only. All eighteen feature rows
remain Not run, and BPR-0577/BPR-0591 independent review, later designated
publication and rendered/native/human evidence remain pending where required.

The new plan JSON/source receipt is a fresh adopted plan under the helper's
required `docs/rfcs/plans/` location. Existing protected plan/pack bytes were not
edited. Live audit, receipt, selection and checkpoint are retained in
`docs/verification/`. Card amendments only activate the owner mandate, link the
plan and correct stale schema facts; future card acceptance and dependencies
remain intact.
